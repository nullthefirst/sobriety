# Introduction

On a rainy day, I thought. For weeks past the length of a baker's dozen, I have pondered on topics as frail as those pertaining to life. To living, I have devoted a considerable number of inward-facing moments to the comprehension of my being. I have sought the wisdom of gods, and strove to understand the whispers of the wind. I have heard the murmurs of the sun, and the humming of the earth. The flame that is my youth, faintly flickers and begs discovery. I have sought for quite a time, to discover the nature of my being. Eventually, this whole parade - the hypothetical ticklings of a forming mind - must come to a sure end.
